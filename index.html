      <p>I am named Landon Von Darnell and I believe I am a Human due to all obervation and known
         information about myself and the outside world. I have the pronouns he/him/his and if not
         colorblind in the slightest have brown hair, brown eyes.. sorry I have white eyeballs and
         brown iris. I also have a black pupil and red veins. It is denoted to Brown eyes for short
         context. I also have white skin although it is not actually white, it is more pink-peach
         (not the fruit) or something like that. I also am 5 foot 8 inch in height.</p>
      <p>This course is named Web Page Design and we learn how to code with HTML, CSS, and a little JAVA to get websites
         up
         and running.

      <p>This portfolio is used to show the information I have learned during each Unit and section of this course. Feel

         I
         learned and not learn it. Why are you even here on my website??</p>
