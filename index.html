         <h1>Web Portfolio</h1>
         <p>I am named Landon Von Darnell and I believe I am a Human due to all obervation and known
            information about myself and the outside world. I have the pronouns he/him/his and if not
            colorblind in the slightest have brown hair, brown eyes.. sorry I have white eyeballs and
            brown iris. I also have a black pupil and red veins. It is denoted to Brown eyes for short
            context. I also have white skin although it is not actually white, it is more pink-peach
            (not the fruit) or something like that. I also am 5 foot 8 inch in height I believe. Who knows maybe I am
            lying to you, because the current version of my self that you may or may never at all know has changed in
            some way from what is on here. At this current time, I do not think myself to be a lair, yet in the future
            or the past somehow??? (are time travelers reading this???) I may have changed in some way to casue myself
            to be lair at that particular moment. Although it would not be changed as I won't care and most likely will
            forget about this if it still a thing. Anyways, who else would be reading this? Maybe I friend I showed it
            to so I feel like I haven't wasted my time doing something useless like typing all this crap out that
            doesn't need to be here. Who knows maybe it all got deleted, because I had to due to some rubric, or just
            because I got mad or for no reason, or perhaps that I am no longer a student and it is gone. Could be saved
            to my GitHub account or this computer perhaps. If neither gets whiped clean for some reason. Maybe when the
            internet dissapates into nothingness near the end of time. I assume maybe, perchance that the only person
            reading this would be me. However, it could have been read by my teacher. Hello. You don't have to say it
            back, infact I would have to be there for you to say it back, so assuming I am still here (not just death,
            other reasons like at home) you could say it. There is no conscious me inside of this computer or wherever
            this information is being stored. Maybe perhaps this information will be unique to you, because it'll be
            read specifically on the pixels and transistors of your device. So it is like a clone that is unique, yet
            also not. Maybe you are infact reading it on my computer, then it is not unique as it is the exact original.
            Nothing that is a copy is ever truly unique, but it still is in it's own way. The only one being showed at
            that specific time in that specific place on that specific device. Still unique, but not in design I guess.
